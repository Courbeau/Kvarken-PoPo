EU: 
Large plants (>20 MW) must track emissions per installation.
Must surrender EU Allowances (EUAs) equal to verified CO₂. = must buy same amount of carbon credits that have been emitted
Reports are audited and standardized. = report must be detailed and data must be proved via (data from engines etc.)
Small plants → voluntary reporting only. = not mandatory, but beneficial in the case of Wärtsilä to achieve carbon neutrality 

China:
Emissions are reported as CO₂ per MWh (intensity). =
Plants must meet benchmarks; inefficient plants buy extra allowances. = stay efficient or buy carbon allowances
CCER offsets allowed for a small part (~5%). = not required but 95% of CO2 offset required. 5% CCER offsets optional but beneficial because it allows to support green projects.
Verification by provincial authorities. = Local authorities verify data of emissions report

US:
Federal reporting mostly voluntary. = Voluntary, but beneficial for every company.
Some states (California, RGGI) → mandatory cap-and-trade. = large plants required to offset carbon emissions with carbon credits
Voluntary reporting/credits for other states. = Smaller plants or plants outside regulated states can report emissions voluntarily and buy voluntary credits if desired.
Companies must track CO₂ and power generation to meet ESG or state obligations. = Depends heavily on the state in which the power plant is in. Platform could have a dedicated state selector (ehkä).
